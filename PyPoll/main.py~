#You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). 
#Each dataset is composed of three columns: 
#Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 
#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
#The total number of votes cast
#A complete list of candidates who received votes
#The percentage of votes each candidate won
#The total number of votes each candidate won
#The winner of the election based on popular vote.

import os
import csv

with open(voters_file_path,'r') as election_file:

      voter_id = vote[0]
      voters.append(voter_id)
      voter_county = vote[1]
      counties.append(voter_county)
      voter_candidate = vote[2]
